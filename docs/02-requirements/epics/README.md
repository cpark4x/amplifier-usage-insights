# Epics

This directory contains epic-level requirements for the Amplifier Usage Insights project.

## What is an Epic?

An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into user stories. Epics typically:
- Represent a significant feature or capability
- Take multiple sprints to complete
- Contain multiple user stories
- Align with project vision and goals

## Creating an Epic

Use the template in `docs/templates/EPIC_TEMPLATE.md` to create new epics.

## Epic Files

Each epic should be a separate markdown file named descriptively:
- `epic-001-data-collection.md`
- `epic-002-usage-analytics.md`
- etc.

## Status

Currently no epics defined. Start by reviewing the vision document and identifying major features.
