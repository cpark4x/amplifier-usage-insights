# User Stories

This directory contains user stories for the Amplifier Usage Insights project.

## What is a User Story?

A user story is a short, simple description of a feature from the perspective of the end user. User stories typically follow this format:

```
As a [type of user]
I want [some goal]
So that [some reason/benefit]
```

## Creating a User Story

Use the template in `docs/templates/USER_STORY_TEMPLATE.md` to create new user stories.

## Organization

User stories should be:
- Named descriptively: `story-001-view-session-metrics.md`
- Linked to parent epics
- Small enough to complete in a single sprint
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria

## Status

Currently no user stories defined. User stories will be created from epics once those are established.
