## Measuring What Matters

### The Questions We Keep Asking

**After every user interaction:**
- [Question about user success]
- [Question about user return]
- [Question about user advocacy]

**After every feature:**
- [Question about feature value]
- [Question about strategic alignment]
- [Question about user impact]

**After every month:**
- [Question about progress]
- [Question about learning]
- [Question about trajectory]

### The Standard

**[One sentence defining the measurement philosophy - e.g., "If a metric doesn't help us answer 'are users achieving their goals?', we don't track it."]**

[Brief explanation of measurement discipline]

## Writing Guidelines

**Purpose of Success Metrics Document:**
- Define how you measure if vision is being achieved
- Distinguish leading indicators (predict success) from lagging (measure success)
- Identify what NOT to measure (vanity metrics)
- Provide phase-specific success criteria
- Guide AI on what matters vs what doesn't

**WHAT to include:**
- Primary success indicator (the north star)
- Phase-specific metrics (V1/V2/V3)
- Leading and lagging indicators
- Qualitative signals (user quotes)
- Anti-metrics (what not to measure and why)
- Success criteria for each phase

**WHAT to exclude:**
- How to implement measurement (technical details)
- Dashboard designs or BI tools
- Historical data or trends (separate analytics doc)
- Individual performance metrics

**For AI context (80%):**
- Help AI understand what "success" means
- Prevent AI from optimizing for wrong metrics
- Guide feature prioritization (does this improve our metrics?)
- Make it clear what we value vs what we ignore

**For human readers (20%):**
- Strategic alignment on what matters
- Clear targets for each phase
- Rationale for metric choices

**Test:** Can AI use this to determine if a feature will improve success metrics? Can stakeholders understand what we're optimizing for?
